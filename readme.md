A simple web app for posting poems. Visitors can post & vote on poems.
Poems posted are ranked by vote count. 
I think the quality of poetry is subjective.
But people like to vote on things.


Challenges Overcome
  - Sorting and updating UI to reflect vote changes
  - Adjusting stylesheets based on vote count
